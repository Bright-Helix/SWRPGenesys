<p>Disclaimer: This page hosts my attempt to update Fantasy Flight Games and Edge Studio's Star Wars Roleplaying Game to better reflect their more recent Genesys Roleplaying Game, as well as house all relevant information for playing games with said conversion, as well as homebrew. This is intended for my own home game and may not be suitable or desirable for all tables. In keeping with this, the main body of this page consists mostly of text copied directly (if lightly edited) from the Genesys Core Rulebook, the Star Wars Roleplaying Game Core Rulebooks, any supplements created for either line, as well as homebrewed and houseruled content created by both the author and various members of the SWRPG and Genesys community, harvested from throughout the internet. This information is presented as part of the larger whole in order to present the game as one, consistent entity for the sake of coherent rules referencing. This work is not for sale, having been produced in my free time without financial benefit, and exists chiefly to act as a reference by me and my players.</p>
