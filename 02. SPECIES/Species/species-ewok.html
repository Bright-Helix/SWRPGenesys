<p><strong>Wound Threshold:</strong> 9 + Brawn<br />
<strong>Strain Threshold:</strong> 11 + Willpower<br />
<strong>Starting Experience:</strong> 120 XP<br />
<strong>Starting Skills:</strong>Â  Ewoks begin the game with one rank in either Stealth or Survival. They still may not train Stealth or Survival above rank 2 during Character Creation.<br />
<strong>Small Size:</strong> Ewoks are smaller than average and count as silhouette 0.<br />
<strong>Active Senses:</strong> Ewoks add 1 Boost Die<span class="tag">StarWarsBoost</span> to Perception and Vigilance checks<br />
<strong>Low Tech User:</strong> Ewoks upgrade the difficulty of any checks involving advanced technology. This counts as any technology not available on the Ewok's home planet, though individual pieces of technology they become familiar with over an extended period of time can become exempt from this at the GM's discretion. Ewoks can spend 10 XP at Character Creation to remove this penalty permanently.</p>
