<p><strong>Wound Threshold:</strong> 11 + Brawn<br />
<strong>Strain Threshold:</strong> 11+ Willpower<br />
<strong>Starting Experience:</strong> 105 XP<br />
<strong>Starting Skills:</strong> Tusken Raiders begin the game with one rank in <a href="survival">Survival</a>. They still may not train Survival above rank 2 during Character Creation.<br />
<strong>Bantha Riders:</strong> When making <a href="athletics">Athletics</a> or Survival checks to handle a Bantha, Tusken Raiders automatically add 1 success to the check.<br />
<strong>Water Reclamator:</strong> Tusken Raiders reduce the difficulty of all <a href="resilience">Resilience</a> and Survival checks related to enduring extreme heat or going without water once.<br />
<strong>Low Tech User</strong>: Sand People upgrade the difficulty of mechanics checks involving advanced technology once. This counts as any technology not available on the Sand Peopleâ€™s home planet, though individual pieces of technology they become familiar with over an extended period of time can become exempt from this at the GM's discretion. Sand People can spend 10 XP at Character Creation to remove this penalty permanently.</p>

<p>(NOTE: Tusken Raiders should only be called Tusken Raiders after 95 BBY, when Fort Tusken was attacked. In their own language, they call themselves something like "Ghrva")</p>
