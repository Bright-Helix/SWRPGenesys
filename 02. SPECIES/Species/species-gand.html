<p><strong>Wound Threshold:</strong> 10 + Brawn<br />
<strong>Strain Threshold:</strong> 10 + Willpower<br />
<strong>Starting Experience:</strong> 110 XP<br />
<strong>Starting Skills:</strong> Gand begin the game with one rank in Discipline. They still may not train Discipline above rank 2 during Character Creation,<br />
<strong>Ammonia Breathers</strong>: One notable difference between the two main sub-species of Gand is that one has lungs and one does not. Those with lungs breathe an ammonia gas mixture. Those without lungs do not respire and gain all necessary metabolic substances through food. When playing a Gand, each player chooses whether they wish his character to have lungs or not. If they select to be playing a lungless Gand, his character is immune to suffocation (but not the wounds suffered from being exposed to vacuum). If they choose to play a Gand with lungs, they start the game with an ammonia respirator, and treats oxygen as a dangerous atmosphere with Rating 8. However, they gain +10 starting XP.</p>
