<strong>Strain Threshold:</strong> 10 + Willpower<br />
<strong>Starting Experience:</strong> 100 XP<br />
<strong>Starting Skills:</strong> Whiphids begin the game with one rank in <a href="survival">Survival</a>. They still may not train Survival above rank 2 during Character Creation.<br />
<strong>Hardy Survivalist</strong>: A Whipid adds an automatic Success to Survival checks and can survive for several weeks without food thanks to reserve blubber.<br />
<strong>Tusks:</strong> When a Whiphid makes a Brawl check to deal damage to an opponent, they deal +2 damage, has a Critical Rating of 4, and a Vicious 1 quality.<br />
<strong>Low Tech User</strong>: Whiphid upgrade the difficulty of mechanics checks involving advanced technology once. This counts as any technology not available on the Whiphidâ€™s home planet, though individual pieces of technology they become familiar with over an extended period of time can become exempt from this at the GM's discretion. Whiphid can spend 10 XP at Character Creation to remove this penalty permanently.</p>
