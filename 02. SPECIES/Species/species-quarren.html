<p><strong>Wound Threshold:</strong> 10 + Brawn<br />
<strong>Strain Threshold:</strong> 8 + Willpower<br />
<strong>Starting Experience:</strong> 105 XP<br />
<strong>Starting Skills:</strong> Quarren begin the game with one rank of <a href="negotiation">Negotiation</a>. They still may not train Negotiation above rank 2 during Character Creation.<br />
<strong>Amphibious:</strong> Quarren can breathe underwater without penalty and never suffer movement penalties for traveling through water. However, Quarren prefer humid environments and suffer a Setback die in overly dry environments.<br />
<strong>Ink Spray:</strong> Quarren can spit ink from a specialized sac within their gills that disperses in water, creating a brief murk used to confuse foes or escape predators. This ability can be used on land as well, though it is considerably less effective because it must be sprayed directly on the target. Once per encounter, as an out-of-turn incidental, a Quarren may suffer 2 strain to add one Setback Die to a combat check maybe by a character within short range (underwater, it adds three Setback Dice to the combat check instead)</p>
