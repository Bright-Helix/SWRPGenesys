<p><strong>Wound Threshold:</strong> 10 + Brawn<br />
<strong>Strain Threshold:</strong> 8 + Willpower<br />
<strong>Starting Experience:</strong> 90 XP<br />

<strong>Methane Breather</strong>: Skakoans require methane to live, and require special pressure suits to emulate the conditions on Skako. They start the game with a specialized pressure suit with methane respirator, which counts as armor with indefinite supplies of methane. The suit has +2 soak, encumbrance of 3, 3 hard points, cannot be acquired unless on Skako (at a price equivalent to laminate armor), and cannot be worn by other species. Skakoans treat standard planetary air pressure and composition as a corrosive atmosphere with rating 6.</p>
