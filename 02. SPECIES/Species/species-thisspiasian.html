<p><strong>Wound Threshold:</strong> 10 + Brawn<br />
<strong>Strain Threshold:</strong> 8 + Willpower<br />
<strong>Starting Experience:</strong> 110 XP<br />
<strong>Starting Skills:</strong> Thisspiasians begins with one rank in <a href="discipline">Discipline</a>. They still may not train Discipline above rank 2 during Character Creation.<br />
<strong>Rest and Meditation:</strong> Thisspasians need very little sleep to function. They only need to sleep for two hours to heal all the strain they suffered from rather than a full night. (They cannot sleep multiple times in a day, however). In addition, once per session Thisspiasians may spend ten minutes meditating; if they do so, they heal strain equal to twice their ranks in Discipline.</p>
