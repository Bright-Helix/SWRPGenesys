<strong>Starting Skills:</strong> Cybernetic implants and specialized lenses for their compound eyes grant Tognath characters one free rank each in <a href="coordination">Coordination</a> and <a href="perception">Perception</a>. They may not train either skill beyond rank 2 at Character Creation. This set of cybernetics counts as 1 implant against a Togneth's limit on cybernetic implants.<br />
<strong>Underdeveloped Nerves:</strong> Add two Setback Dice to Coercion checks targeting Tognath characters.<br />
<strong>Atmospheric Requirements</strong>: Tognaths must wear a specialized mask or breathing apparatus to breathe outside their native atmosphere. Tognath characters start the game with a breath mask and treat oxygen as a corrosive atmosphere with rating 5. However, they can survive in vacuum for up to five minutes before suffering its effects.</p>
