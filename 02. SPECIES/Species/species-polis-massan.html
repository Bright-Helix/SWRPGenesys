<p><strong>Wound Threshold:</strong> 8 + Brawn<br />
<strong>Strain Threshold:</strong> 11 + Willpower<br />
<strong>Starting Experience:</strong> 110 XP<br />
<strong>Starting Skills:</strong> Polis Massans begin the game with one rank in either Knowledge (<a href="xenology">Xenology</a>) or <a href="medicine">Medicine</a>. They still may not train Knowledge (Xenology) or Medicine above rank 2 during Character Creation.<br />
<strong>No Vocal Chords:</strong> The vast majority of Polis Massans are born without vocal chords, though a small subset does possess them. Referred to as "Speakers" by their people, those rate individuals can physically speak languages, though their voices are soft and strangely resonant. When creating a Polis Massan character, a player may spend 10 starting XP to specify that the character possesses vocal chords.<br />
<strong>Telepathy:</strong> Polis Massans can communicate with other beings using a simple form of telepathy, and anyone within short range "hears" the Polis Massasn's speech. Polis Massans can only "whisper" privately to beings within engaged range.</p>
