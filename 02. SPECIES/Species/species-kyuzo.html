<p><strong>Wound Threshold:</strong> 11 + Brawn<br />
<strong>Strain Threshold:</strong> 11 + Willpower<br />
<strong>Starting Experience:</strong> 90 XP<br />
<strong>Starting Skills:</strong> Kyuzo begin the game with one rank in <a href="coordination">Coordination</a>. They still may not train Coordination above rank 2 during Character Creation.<br />
<strong>Dense Musculature:</strong> Kyuzo are adapted for Phatrong's relatively high gravity, and can make impressive bounding leaps on most other worlds. Once per round as a maneuver, a Kyuzo may suffer 3 strain to leap horizontally or vertically to any location within medium range.<br />
<strong>High-Pressure Adaptations:</strong> Phatrong's high gravity and unusually dense atmosphere causes many Kyuzo issues when in more standard atmosphere, similar to what most sentients experience at high altitude. A Kyuzo begins the game with a filter mask to operate normally. Without the filter mask, a Kyuzo suffers a Setback die to all checks.</p>
