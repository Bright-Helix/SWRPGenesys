<p><strong>Wound Threshold:</strong> 12 + Brawn<br />
<strong>Strain Threshold:</strong> 10 + Willpower<br />
<strong>Starting Experience:</strong> 95 XP<br />
<strong>Starting Skills:</strong> Lasats begin the game with one rank in either <a href="brawl">Brawl</a> or Knowledge (<a href="lore">Lore</a>). They still may not train Brawl or Knowledge (Lore) above rank 2 during Character Creation.<br />
<strong>Prehensile Feet:</strong> Lasats can move along vertical surfaces as if the surface was horizontal.<br />
Temperature Adaptations: Lasat's tend to live in the wide, flat deserts of Lasan, their large ears act as a way to disperse heat, and their fur protects them from the desert nights. Lasats remove one Setback die for cold or hot conditions.<br />
Night Vision: Lasats have developed large eyes that take in as much light as possible, giving them excellent nightvision, but leaving them vulnerable to bright flashes. Lasats remove one Setback die imposed by darkness, but add one Setback for bright conditions.</p>
