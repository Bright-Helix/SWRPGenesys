<p><strong>Wound Threshold:</strong> 9 + Brawn<br />
<strong>Strain Threshold:</strong> 9 + Willpower<br />
<strong>Starting Experience:</strong> 105 XP<br />
<strong>Starting Skills:</strong> Clawdites begin the game with one rank in <a href="resilience">Resilience</a>. They still may not train Resilience above rank 2 during Character Creation.<br />
Changeline:** As an action, a Clawdite may suffer 3 Strain and make an <strong>Average (<span class="tag">StarWarsDifficulty</span><span class="tag">StarWarsDifficulty</span>) Resilience check</strong>. If the Clawdite succeeds, they change their appearance to match that of a Silhouette 1 character whom they have observed before. An observing character must make an <strong>opposed Perception vs. Deception check</strong> to detect that something is amiss with the impersonated character's likeness, mannerisms, or behavior. As always, the GM can add Boosts or Setbacks for situational effects that might affect the check, such as a Boost if the Clawdite's garb does not match the expectations or a Setback if the Clawdite has studied the impersonated individual's mannerisms closely.</p>
