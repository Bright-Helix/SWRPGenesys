<p><strong>Wound Threshold:</strong> 11 + Brawn<br />
<strong>Strain Threshold:</strong> 10 + Willpower<br />
<strong>Starting Experience:</strong> 90 XP<br />
<strong>Starting Skills:</strong> Selonians begin the game with one rank in <a href="coordination">Coordination</a>. They still may not train Coordination above rank 2 during Character Creation.<br />
<strong>Cavers:</strong> The structure of a Selonian's eyes allows them to see in near total darkness. They may remove all Setback Dice added to checks due to darkness, though she still cannot see in absolute darkness. However, they suffer one Setback die in bright environments.<br />
<strong>Tail</strong>: A Selonian's tail may be used as a Brawl weapon. When used to attack, it uses the Brawl skill combined with the Agility characteristic, but like most Brawl weapons adds its weapon damage to the character's Brawn for total damage. It always counts as equipped, and has the following weapon profile (Brawl; Damage +1; Critical 5; Range [Engaged]; Disorient 2, Knockdown). The Selonian may trigger Knockdown with Advantage, but still must spend additional Advantages to knock down targets with higher Silhouette as per the Knockdown quality rules.</p>
