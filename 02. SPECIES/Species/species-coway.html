<p><strong>Wound Threshold:</strong> 10 + Brawn<br />
<strong>Strain Threshold:</strong> 10 + Willpower<br />
<strong>Starting Experience:</strong> 120 XP<br />
<strong>Starting Skills:</strong> Coway begin the game with one rank in <a href="melee">Melee</a>. Coway still may not train Melee above rank 2 during character creation.<br />
<strong>Low Tech User:</strong> Coway upgrade the difficulty of any checks involving advanced technology. This counts as any technology not available on the Cowayâ€™s home planet, though individual pieces of technology they become familiar with over an extended period of time can become exempt from this at the GM's discretion. Coway can spend 10 XP at Character Creation to remove this penalty permanently.</p>
